# SPEECH-RECOGNITION

This project implements a Speech Recognition system that coverts spoken language into text using modern machine learning and natural language procrssing techniues.

## üéØ Purpose
The purpose of this project is to convert spoken language into written text using speech recognition technology, making human-computer interaction more natural and accessible.

## ‚ú®Features
1.Real-Time Speech Recognition
2. Voice Command Execution
3. Customizable Command List 
4. Real-Time Processing
5. Error Handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used
Programming Language: Java
Frameworks/Libraries:
Google Speech API or CMU Sphinx for speech recognition.
Database: No database required for this project, as the commands and configuration will be stored in a
file (JSON or plain text).

## üß†OOP Conceot Used
Encapsulation:
Data hiding will be applied by using private fields and providing public getters and setters. For example,
user command lists and configuration settings will be encapsulated in classes.

Inheritance:
Subclasses will inherit common functionalities. For example, different command types (e.g., opening
applications, searching) can inherit from a base command class.

Polymorphism:
Method overloading will be used to allow multiple methods with the same name but different
parameters, e.g., methods for recognizing speech in different formats.
Method overriding will be used to customize behavior for specific command classes.

Abstraction:
The implementation details of speech recognition and command execution will be hidden from the user,
with only the relevant interfaces exposed.

## ‚öôÔ∏èProject Phases with Estimated Completion Times:

Phase 1: Requirements and Design (1day)
Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation (2days)
Phase 3: Command Customization and Real-time Processing (2 days)
Phase 4: Testing and Debugging (1day)
Phase 5: Final Documentation and Deployment (1day)

## üéâ Outcome

By the end of this project, users will have a functional speech recognition system capable of accurately converting spoken language into text. It will support both live microphone input and pre-recorded audio files, with potential for multilingual support and user-friendly interaction.
